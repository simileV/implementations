"""
transparently reuse existing instances of objects with similar/identical state
Minimizes memory usage by sharing data with other similar objects.

A Flyweight is an object shared by multiple
contexts, and is indistinguishable from an object that is not shared.

Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state
between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
